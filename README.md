# Classification-of-Health-Risks-and-Speech-Disorders
Predicting maternal health risks and classifying speech disorders through feature selection and various classification algorithms.

## part one:

This project involves the analysis of maternal health risk data using various machine learning algorithms. The primary goal is to build predictive models for risk assessment based on the provided dataset named "Maternal Health Risk Data Set.csv."

1. **Data Preprocessing**

1.1. Feature Selection

A subset of relevant features is selected and stored in a new DataFrame named new_data_frame. This subset includes columns 0 to 5 from the original dataset.

1.2. Encoding Target Variable

The target variable, representing maternal health risk levels, is encoded into numerical values as follows:

'low risk' is encoded as 0
'mid risk' is encoded as 1
'high risk' is encoded as 2

2. **Train-Test Split**

The dataset is split into training and test sets. Approximately 70% of the data is used for training, and 30% is reserved for testing. Random indices are selected to achieve this split.

3. **Model Building and Evaluation**

The project employs several machine learning algorithms for modeling and evaluation. Each algorithm is explored with different parameter settings.

Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest

4. **Model Evaluation Metrics**

For each model, the following evaluation metrics are calculated:

Accuracy on the test set
Accuracy on the training set
Cross-validation score (average accuracy)
Confusion matrix

## part tow:
This project involves the analysis of speech features data for the classification of speech disorders. The primary objective is to build and evaluate machine learning models to classify speech samples into two categories: healthy (1) and speech disorders (0). The dataset used for this project is named "pd_speech_features.csv."

1. **Data Preprocessing**

1.1. Feature Selection

A subset of relevant features is selected and stored in a new DataFrame named new_data_frame. This subset includes all columns except the first one, which is assumed to be an identifier.

1.2. Train-Test Split

The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set. Approximately 70% of the data is used for training, and 30% is set aside for testing. Randomly selected rows are used for each split.

1.3. Encoding Target Variable

The target variable, representing the classification labels, is encoded as follows:

Healthy speech (Class 1) is encoded as 1.
Speech disorders (Class 0) are encoded as 0.

2. **Model Building and Evaluation**

Machine learning models are built and evaluated using the training and test datasets. Three types of models are explored: Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests. Different parameter settings are tested for each model.

3. **Model Evaluation Metrics**

For each model, the following evaluation metrics are calculated:

Accuracy on the test set
Accuracy on the training set
Cross-validation score (average accuracy)
Confusion matrix
